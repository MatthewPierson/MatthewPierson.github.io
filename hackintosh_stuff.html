		For those who don't know, a Hackintosh is any non-Apple computer which runs a version of MacOS and can be a laptop or a desktop PC either or. Hackintoshes are a legal grey area as there have been lawsuits in the past regarding the commercialization of hackintoshes but it seems that Apple doesn't care about individuals creating hackintoshes for personal use. I personally have MacOS Mojave (10.14.1) running on my laptop as I prefer MacOS as an operating system over windows and have had MacOS versions running on my PC over the years. <br><br>Hackintoshes are not easy to create, it can take hours to even get your machine to boot the MacOS installer. As it can be very hacky and not always stable, there are lots of inherit issues that will come with your MacOS install. One current issue is that Apple is preventing Nvidia from releasing signed MacOS drivers for their last three generations of GPU's, meaning that anyone with one of these GPU's (such as myself) are unable to get graphics acceleration in MacOS which causes laggy and broken animations and just overall slow performance. AMD CPU's are also hit or miss when it comes to hackintoshes. Some older chips from AMD's FX lineup are flatout not supported by some versions of MacOS and some newer chips like my 2400G have early support thanks to some insanly talented individuals, but the intergrated GPU doesn't work and since my GPU isn't supported either it means MacOS isn't an option for me on my desktop PC.<br><br>I personally love the challenge of trying to get MacOS working on any new piece of hardware I get whether thats a old laptop or a whole new desktop as I think MacOS is one of the best OS's out there, but the high price tag for Apple computers is a massive turn off for a student like me. With the right hardware, like the stuff in my laptop, installing MacOS is extremely easy which gives me access to MacOS and what that brings for free, as Apple provides a download for MacOS versions for free from any real mac. This has given me the perfect laptop for university, minus the fact my laptops cruddy battery lasts one lecture then dies.<br><br>To anyone thinking of making a hackintosh, 
		<b><a href="https://hackintosh.gitbook.io/-r-hackintosh-vanilla-desktop-guide/">this guide</a></b> is a great comprehensive tutorial to making a vanilla hackintosh. This guide says - <i>"A vanilla setup implies that the OS itself remains relatively untouched - and that the bulk of the Hackintosh-related kexts, patches, etc are contained on the EFI partition. For all intents and purposes, a vanilla install's main partition is identical to that of an official Apple computer."</i> This technique is the safest and simplist as it allows for upgrades to newer versions of MacOS (small 10.14.x - 10.14.xx releases only not 10.13.x - 10.14.x) and if anything goes wrong you can boot using a known working USB and none of the broken or bad files will be on the data partitions of your MacOS drive.
